# Personal Test Website

This is a website being built in HTML for purposes of learning and testing. It will eventually include CSS :)

## FAQs: (even tho no one is actually asking)

**What text editor are you using?**

>It is being developed in Visual Studio Code. The HTML Viewer plugin is also helpful for a live preview of the site before it is pushed to the server.

**Is there a URL I can type in to view it?**

>Yes. It will eventually be [JoshJacobsen.me](http://www.JoshJacobsen.me)
